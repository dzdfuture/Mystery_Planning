      "Step 1: The initial state has harmony, and 'c' is a province. We can use the 'attack' action on 'c' since it is both a province and a planet (implicitly assumed for the sake of planning). This will disrupt harmony and cause 'c' to be in pain.",
      "Step 2: With 'c' in pain, we can now use the 'succumb' action on 'c' to restore it as a province and planet, and bring back harmony.",
      "Step 3: Now that harmony is restored and 'c' is a province, we can use the 'feast' action on 'c' and 'b' because 'c' craves 'b'. This will make 'c' in pain again, but 'b' will become a province.",
      "Step 4: With 'c' in pain and 'b' as a province, we can use the 'overcome' action on 'd' and 'b'. This will make 'd' crave 'b', satisfying part of the goal.",
