      "Step 1: We start with the 'feast' action with 'a' and 'b' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'a' craves 'b', 'a' is a province, and there is harmony. All these conditions are satisfied in the initial state. The effects of this action are that 'a' is in pain, 'b' becomes a province, 'a' no longer craves 'b', 'a' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony.",
      "Step 2: We then use the 'overcome' action with 'b' and 'a' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'a' is in pain and 'b' is a province. These conditions are satisfied after the first action. The effects of this action are that there is harmony, 'b' becomes a province, 'b' craves 'a', 'a' is no longer a province, and 'a' is no longer in pain.",
      "Step 3: We use the 'feast' action again, this time with 'b' and 'c' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'b' craves 'c', 'b' is a province, and there is harmony. These conditions are satisfied after the second action. The effects of this action are that 'b' is in pain, 'c' becomes a province, 'b' no longer craves 'c', 'b' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony.",
      "Step 4: We use the 'overcome' action again, this time with 'c' and 'b' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'b' is in pain and 'c' is a province. These conditions are satisfied after the third action. The effects of this action are that there is harmony, 'c' becomes a province, 'c' craves 'b', 'b' is no longer a province, and 'b' is no longer in pain.",
      "Step 5: We use the 'feast' action for the last time with 'c' and 'd' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'c' craves 'd', 'c' is a province, and there is harmony. These conditions are satisfied after the fourth action. The effects of this action are that 'c' is in pain, 'd' becomes a province, 'c' no longer craves 'd', 'c' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony.",
      "Step 6: We use the 'overcome' action for the last time with 'd' and 'c' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'c' is in pain and 'd' is a province. These conditions are satisfied after the fifth action. The effects of this action are that there is harmony, 'd' becomes a province, 'd' craves 'a', 'c' is no longer a province, and 'c' is no longer in pain. This satisfies the goal state."
