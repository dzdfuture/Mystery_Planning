The 'succumb' action is used to return 'd' to a state of being a planet and a province, return us to a state of harmony, and remove 'd's pain. The 'overcome' action is used to make 'b' crave 'd', make 'b' a province, and remove 'd's status as a province and 'b's pain.

The 'succumb' action is used again to return 'c' to a state of being a planet and a province, return us to a state of harmony, and remove 'c's pain.

      "Step 1: We start with the action 'attack' on 'd' because 'd' is a planet and we are in a state of harmony. This will result in 'd' being in pain and no longer being a planet or a province, and we will no longer be in a state of harmony.",
      "Step 2: We then use the action 'succumb' on 'd'. This is possible because 'd' is in pain. The effect of this action is that 'd' becomes a province and a planet, we return to a state of harmony, and 'd' is no longer in pain.",
      "Step 3: We then use the action 'overcome' with 'b' and 'd'. This is possible because 'd' is a province and 'b' is in pain. The effect of this action is that we return to a state of harmony, 'b' becomes a province, 'b' now craves 'd', 'd' is no longer a province, and 'b' is no longer in pain.",
      "Step 4: We then use the action 'feast' with 'c' and 'b'. This is possible because 'c' craves 'b', 'c' is a province, and we are in a state of harmony. The effect of this action is that 'c' is in pain, 'b' becomes a province, 'c' no longer craves 'b', 'c' is no longer a province, and we are no longer in a state of harmony.",
      "Step 5: We then use the action 'succumb' on 'c'. This is possible because 'c' is in pain. The effect of this action is that 'c' becomes a province and a planet, we return to a state of harmony, and 'c' is no longer in pain.",
      "Step 6: Finally, we use the action 'overcome' with 'd' and 'c'. This is possible because 'c' is a province and 'd' is in pain. The effect of this action is that we return to a state of harmony, 'd' becomes a province, 'd' now craves 'c', 'c' is no longer a province, and 'd' is no longer in pain.
