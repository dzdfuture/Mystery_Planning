The effect of this action will be to cause 'a' to feel pain, and it will no longer be a province or a planet, and the state will no longer be in harmony.",
      "Step 2: Next, use the 'overcome' action with 'd' and 'a'. This action is chosen because 'd' is a province and 'a' is in pain, satisfying the preconditions. The effect of this action will be to bring the state back into harmony, make 'd' a province, make 'a' crave 'd', and remove the province status from 'a' and the pain from 'd'.",
