Next, 'b' is feasted upon with 'a', causing 'a' to feel pain and 'd' to become a province. 'a' no longer craves 'd' and 'b' loses its province status.

Finally, 'b' is overcome with 'a', restoring harmony, making 'a' a province, making 'a' crave 'b', removing 'b' as a province, and removing the pain from 'a'.
