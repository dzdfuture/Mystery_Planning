This disrupts the harmony and causes 'a' to be in pain. Next, 'a' overcomes 'b', which satisfies the precondition of 'a' being in pain and 'b' being a province. This restores the harmony and causes 'a' to crave 'b'. Then, 'c' feasts on 'd', which satisfies the precondition of 'c' craving 'd' and being a province. This disrupts the harmony and causes 'c' to be in pain. After that, 'c' overcomes 'd', which satisfies the precondition of 'c' being in pain and 'd' being a province.
