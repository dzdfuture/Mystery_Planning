Next, 'b' feasts on 'a' which causes 'b' to be in pain, makes 'a' a province, and disrupts the harmony. After that, 'b' overcomes with the help of 'c' which restores the province status of 'b', makes 'c' crave 'b', brings back harmony, and removes the province status of 'c'. Then, 'd' is attacked to cause it to be in pain and disrupt the harmony. Finally, 'd' overcomes with the help of 'c' which restores the province status of 'd', makes 'c' crave 'd', brings back harmony, and removes the craving of 'b' from 'c'.
