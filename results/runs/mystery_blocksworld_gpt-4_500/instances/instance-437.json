This results in 'b' being in pain and the removal of harmony. Next, 'b' overcomes its pain with the help of 'a' which is a province. This results in 'a' craving 'b' and 'b' becoming a province. Then, 'a' succumbs to its pain, restoring harmony and making 'a' a planet. Afterwards, 'b' feasts on 'a' which it craves. This results in 'b' being in pain and 'a' no longer being a province. Next, 'c' overcomes its pain with the help of 'b' which is a province. This results in 'b' craving 'c' and 'c' becoming a province. Finally, 'c' feasts on 'b' which it craves.
