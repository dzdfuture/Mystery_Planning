Then, 'b' overcomes its pain by craving 'a', which causes 'a' to no longer be a province and restores harmony. Next, 'b' feasts on 'a', causing 'b' to be in pain again and disrupting the harmony. After that, 'a' overcomes its pain by craving 'd', which causes 'd' to no longer be a province and restores harmony. Then, 'a' feasts on 'd', causing 'a' to be in pain again and disrupting the harmony. Finally, 'd' overcomes its pain by craving 'c', which causes 'c' to no longer be a province and restores harmony.
