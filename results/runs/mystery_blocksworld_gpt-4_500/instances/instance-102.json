Next, 'b' succumbs to its pain, restoring its province and planet status and restoring harmony. Then, 'b' is overcome by 'a', causing 'a' to crave 'b', become a province, and restore harmony. 'b' loses its province status and 'a' loses its pain. Afterwards, 'a' feasts on 'c', causing 'a' to feel pain, 'c' to become a province, and harmony to be lost.
