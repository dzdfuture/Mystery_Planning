The 'succumb' action is used to remove pain from an object and make it a province and a planet again. The 'feast' action is used to cause pain to an object, make another object a province, remove the craving of the first object for the second, remove the province status of the first object and the harmony. The 'overcome' action is used to restore harmony, make an object a province, make it crave another object, remove the province status of the second object and the pain from the first object.
