Then we succumb 'c' to restore its status and harmony. Next, we feast on 'a' with 'b' to put 'a' in pain, make 'b' a province, and remove the craving of 'a' for 'b'. We then overcome 'a' with 'c' to make 'a' crave 'c' and remove its pain. Next, we feast on 'b' with 'd' to put 'b' in pain, make 'd' a province, and remove the craving of 'b' for 'd'. Finally, we overcome 'b' with 'd' to make 'b' crave 'd' and remove its pain. This plan achieves the goal because at the end 'a' craves 'c' and 'b' craves 'd'.",
