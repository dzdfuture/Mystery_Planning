      "Step 2: We then 'succumb' 'd' because 'd' is in 'pain'. This will result in 'd' becoming a 'province' and a 'planet' again and we will be in a state of 'harmony', and 'd' will no longer be in 'pain'.",
      "Step 3: We then 'overcome' 'd' with 'b' because 'd' is a 'province' and 'b' is in 'pain'. This will result in 'b' no longer being in 'pain', 'd' no longer being a 'province', and 'b' will now 'crave' 'd'.",
      "Step 4: We then 'feast' 'b' on 'a' because 'b' 'craves' 'a', 'b' is a 'province', and we are in a state of 'harmony'. This will result in 'a' becoming a 'province', 'b' no longer being a 'province', 'b' no longer 'craving' 'a', and we will no longer be in a state of 'harmony'.",
      "Step 5: We then 'overcome' 'a' with 'b' because 'a' is a 'province' and 'b' is in 'pain'. This will result in 'b' no longer being in 'pain', 'a' no longer being a 'province', and 'a' will now 'crave' 'b'.",
      "Step 6: Finally, we 'overcome' 'd' with 'c' because 'd' is a 'province' and 'c' is in 'pain'. This will result in 'c' no longer being in 'pain', 'd' no longer being a 'province', and 'd' will now 'crave' 'c'."
