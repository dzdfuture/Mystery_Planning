Then 'd' overcomes 'a' which restores harmony, makes 'a' a province again, and makes 'd' crave 'a'. Next, 'b' is attacked to create a state of pain and remove it from being a province and a planet. 'c' then overcomes 'b' which restores harmony, makes 'b' a province again, and makes 'c' crave 'b'. Finally, 'a' feasts on 'c' which causes 'a' to feel pain, makes 'c' a province, and removes the craving of 'a' for 'c'. This also removes 'a' from being a province and disrupts the harmony.
