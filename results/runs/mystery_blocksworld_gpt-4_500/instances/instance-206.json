This can be achieved by attacking each object and then having them overcome their pain with the object they should crave. The attack action disrupts harmony and causes the object to be in pain, but also removes its status as a province and a planet. The overcome action restores harmony, removes the pain from the object, makes it a province again, and makes it crave the object used to overcome the pain.
