All these preconditions are satisfied in the initial state. The effects of this action are that 'a' is in pain, 'c' becomes a province, 'a' no longer craves 'c', 'a' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony.",
      "Step 2: We then perform the action 'overcome' with 'a' and 'b' as parameters. The preconditions for this action are that 'b' is a province and 'a' is in pain. These preconditions are satisfied after the first action. The effects of this action are that there is harmony, 'a' becomes a province, 'a' craves 'b', 'b' is no longer a province, and 'a' is no longer in pain.",

These preconditions are satisfied after the second action. The effects of this action are that 'b' is in pain, 'd' becomes a province, 'b' no longer craves 'd', 'b' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony.",

These preconditions are satisfied after the third action. The effects of this action are that there is harmony, 'b' becomes a province, 'b' craves 'a', 'a' is no longer a province, and 'b' is no longer in pain.",

These preconditions are satisfied after the fourth action. The effects of this action are that 'a' is in pain, 'b' becomes a province, 'a' no longer craves 'b', 'a' is no longer a province, and there is no harmony."
