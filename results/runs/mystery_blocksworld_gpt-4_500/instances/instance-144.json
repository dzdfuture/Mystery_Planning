      "Step 1: The initial state has harmony, a craves b, b craves d, c is a planet, d craves c, and a is a province. The goal is for c to crave b. To achieve this, we need to make c a province and make it crave b. We can start by using the 'feast' action with a and b as parameters. This action requires that a craves b (which is true) and that a is a province (which is also true). The effects of this action will be that a will be in pain, b will become a province, and a will no longer crave b or be a province.",
      "Step 2: Now that a is in pain and b is a province, we can use the 'overcome' action with a and b as parameters. This action requires that b is a province (which is true) and that a is in pain (which is also true). The effects of this action will be that there will be harmony, a will become a province and crave b, b will no longer be a province, and a will no longer be in pain.",
      "Step 3: Now that a is a province and craves b, we can use the 'feast' action again, but this time with a and b as parameters. This action requires that a craves b (which is true) and that a is a province (which is true). The effects of this action will be that a will be in pain, b will become a province, and a will no longer crave b or be a province.",
