The 'overcome' action allows a province to crave another object that is in pain, and also restores harmony. The 'succumb' action allows an object in pain to become a province and a planet again, and also restores harmony. The 'feast' action allows a province that craves another object to cause that object to become a province, but also causes the feasting province to be in pain and disrupts harmony.
